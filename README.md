# HScreenCapture
Python malware that periodically captures screenshots on host device, sends them to an email server, and deletes the images from local disk.

The malware requires a Mailtrap account, and python3 must be running on the victim device. Alternatively, use Nuitka Commercial to package it as an .exe file - Nuitka free version will not work.

Tested on Linux and Windows, 7/8/10
